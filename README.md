## Kaylee Vo's Data Science Portfolio

### About Me

Hello! My name is Kaylee and I’m a first-year masters student at Harvard, studying Data Science. Before, I worked as a data scientist in San Francisco and received my Bachelors of Arts in Economics at Stanford, where I was also a research fellow at the Center of Poverty and Inequality.

In terms of academics, I love statistics, specifically causal inference and optimization. Machine learning is interesting too, a close second.

Outside of academics, I’m an animal lover. I frequent acquariums, zoos, cafes and own many plushies 🐕. I’m also a fan of all things Korea related like K-Dramas, K-Pop, fashion, makeup, and practicing Korean. Favorite drama is Queen of Tears 👑 and favorite group is BTS 💜.
